Project Overview is Based on Data Visualisation

# Maritime Archaeology Shipwreck Data


This Project brings an remarkable interaction exploration of Ships dataset from various individuals, using the D3.js library to parse and visualize from the comprehensive JSON dataset. The initiative aims to reveil the built and lost ships and dememonastrate the purpose of manufacturing the ships. Each ship has its own history of purpess,built,lost etc.The variety of Data visualization is shown in by selecting the drop down regions of the ship area and next by selecting the ship name . The visualization effort extends to display demographic metadata and content of each datset is explained. The project is hosted on GitHub Page,inviting users to engage with the meainingfull and interactive information. This project highlights is the data visualization tools and understand the concept of open data and web technologies to create informative and engaging tools for historical exploration. By transforming the "Shipwrecks" dataset into an interactive map and webpage, we provide a valuable resource for educators, historians, and the general public interested in Western Australia's maritime heritage.

## Data

The "Shipwrecks" dataset, available on the Government of Western Australia's data catalog website, provided comprehensive information about historical shipwrecks along the Western Australian coast. This dataset was formatted in GeoJSON, making it ideal for spatial analysis and visualization. The project's objective was to leverage this rich dataset to create an engaging and informative interactive map and webpage that would allow users to explore the locations and details of these shipwrecks.

## Technologies Used are:

1 Data Acquisition and Preparation:

-   Obtained the "Shipwrecks" dataset from the Government of Western Australia's open data portal.
-   Processed the GeoJSON data to ensure compatibility with web mapping tools.

2 Interactive Map Development:

-   Utilized mapping libraries such as Leaflet and Python to visualize the shipwreck data. Incorporated features to allow users to interact with the map, including zooming, panning, and clicking on shipwreck locations to reveal additional information.

3 Webpage Creation:

-   Developed a user-friendly webpage to host the interactive map.
-   Included supplementary information about the shipwrecks, such as historical context and significance, to enhance the user experience.

## Significance 
The overview of the project is on shipwrecks. They are historically significant as they provide valuable insights into maritime history, trade routes, naval architecture, and cultural exchanges. They often hold artifacts and remains that can shed light on past civilizations, technological advancements, and even the circumstances surrounding their demise. Researching shipwrecks can help archaeologists, historians, and marine scientists better understand human exploration, trade networks, and environmental conditions throughout history. Additionally, studying shipwrecks can contribute to conservation efforts and the preservation of underwater cultural heritage.

## Conclusion 
This project demonstrates the potential of open data and web technologies to create informative and engaging tools for historical exploration. By transforming the "Shipwrecks" dataset into an interactive map and webpage, we provide a valuable resource for educators, historians, and the general public interested in Western Australia's maritime heritage.

## Ethical Considerations 
Throughout the project, significant efforts were made to address ethical considerations, particularly regarding the sensitive nature of the shipwreck data. The project also adhered to data usage policies outlined by the Government of Western Australia, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards. No personal data that could interfere with privacy policies was included in the project. The dataset was sourced from the authentic Government of Western Australia website, ensuring its credibility and adherence to data usage policies and ethical standards.
